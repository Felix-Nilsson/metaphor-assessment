Problem 1: Same track may have been uploaded several times, so picking
the most similar each time may lead to duplicates.
Solution: Pick a response with lower similarity score, and hope 
the song does not have too many duplicates.
In a real application we could filter the results in a smarter way
(also could get stuck in loop: most relevant of a is b and
 vice versa


Problem 2: The application is wasteful, since only a small fraction
of the spent tokens will be used in constructing the result

Problem 3: Different domains have different querying speeds,
for example, youtube is much faster than soundcloud or bandcamp
(probably is a more popular source)

Problem 4: Long inputs sometimes seem to yield no results, 
making the starting point URL get an indexation error. 
E.g. try entering "smells like teen spirit"
